title: What makes a puzzle?
---

I've been thinking about what make a good puzzle.

Puzzles can be broken down into three important characteristics. They must be *at least* 2/3 of:

1. Familiar
2. Concise
3. Satisfying

===

# Familiar

---

A familiar puzzle is something we can relate to - an idea or concept we frequently see in our daily lives framed differently. 

[Wordle](/) and [Geoguessr](/) are excellent examples of this. How often do you see language repurposed in such a way? When was the last time you had to guess where you were?

# Concise

---

A concise puzzle is instantly understandable. When you pick up a rubik's cube, you *instantly* know that you have to make each side the same colour.

A good litmus test for this criterion is whether your puzzle can be explained in less than a sentence.

===

Wordle is a vocabulary game in which players get six tries to deduce a word of the day.

Geoguessr is a game in which the player is given a location in Google Street View and asked to guess precisely where in the world they are.

# Satisfying

---

Probably the most important of these criterion - satisfaction. This can be split into two parts.

## During the solve

The puzzle has to invite you in and encourage you to play with it.

## After the solve

It must feel rewarding and immediately obvious you've solved the puzzle. Don't obscure or defer whether the puzzle has been solved or not. The "eureka" moment is vital and the time between the solve and finishing the puzzle should be minimised.

Don't let your puzzle drag on. Make sure the player knows it's solved and allow them to move on quickly.
