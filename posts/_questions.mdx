title: Building maths questions

Recently I watched the MIT integration bee and it got me thinking. How do you come up with these questions? Where do you start when you want to write a difficult integral?

The commentators gave some hints:

> Some of the most gnarly looking questions often became incredibly simple when integrated.

Question:

---

<m>int_0^infty (e^-2x * sin(3x)) / x dx</m>

---

Evaluates to:

---

<m>arctan(3/2)</m>

Cool, right?

## Write your own questions

Why don't we use this concept to write our *own* questions. 

1. Pick a really simple function
2. Mutate it a few times (we'll go into how this is done later)
3. Take the derivative
4. Pose the derivative as an integral

As you can see, it's easy to make an integral which is wayyyy too hard with just a few simple steps.

Generating an easy integral is also trivial.

However, getting the right amount of difficulty (hard enough to be non-trivial, but easy enough that it can be solved in 4 minutes) is challenging.

<m>sin(x)</m>

↓

---

<m>sin(x)cos(x)</m>

↓

---

<m>sin^2(3x)cos(x+2)</m>

↓

---

<m>int (-5*sin(7*x+2)+7*sin(5*x-2)-70*sin(x+2))/140 dx</m>

What if we add a "weight" to each operation?

Then, we can assign a budget to the difficulty of each question. Some permutations, like adding a constant, are inexpensive and do not add to the difficulty of an integral much.

Some operations, such as an inverse, may make an integral extremely difficult.

| <m> ? * 5 </m>  | Weight: 2 |
| <m> ? ^ 5 </m> | Weight: 3 |
| <m> 1/? </m>    | Weight: 5 |
