## What is picoCFD?

picoCFD is an unnecessarily minimal implementation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The entire simulation, including visualization, fits in a single file. It's not fast, it's not feature-rich, but it's educational!

## The Physics Behind It

The simulation solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations:

1. Conservation of mass:
2. Conservation of momentum:

We use a grid-based approach with:
- Semi-Lagrangian advection for stability
- Pressure projection for incompressibility
- Simple explicit time stepping

<m>‚àÇu/‚àÇt + (u¬∑‚àá)u = -‚àáp + ŒΩ‚àá¬≤u</m>

## Implementation Highlights

The simulation cycle follows these steps:
1. Apply external forces
2. Diffuse velocities
3. Project for incompressibility
4. Advect velocities
5. Project again

===
```rust
// Core simulation parameters
const DT: f32 = 0.016;    // 60 FPS time step
const VISC: f32 = 0.001;  // Fluid viscosity
const NITER: usize = 8;   // Pressure solver iterations
```
===

## Visualization

We use a simple velocity-to-color mapping:
- Red ‚Üí High velocity
- Blue ‚Üí Low velocity

This creates an intuitive visualization of the flow patterns.

## Why Rust?

Rust provides:
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Memory safety
- Easy integration with graphics APIs
- Great performance without optimization

## Running The Simulation

Watch as the fluid swirls and eddies form in real-time!

===

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lewis-carson/picoCFD
cd picoCFD
cargo run --release
```

===

## Limitations

picoCFD is intentionally minimal:
- No turbulence modeling
- No boundary layer resolution
- Single-phase flow only
- Fixed grid resolution

But that's the point! It's a learning tool, not a research platform.

---

## Conclusion

picoCFD shows that fluid dynamics simulation doesn't have to be complex. While it's not suitable for real engineering work, it's perfect for learning the basics of CFD implementation.
