title: Trees Too Large to Count
---

Today I wrote a small crate [willow](https://github.com/lewis-carson/willow) that can be used to lazily traverse trees. It's a bit of a niche library, but I thought I'd share it anyway.

The idea is that you can build a tree of nodes, and then traverse it in a lazy fashion. This is useful if you have a tree that is very deep, but you only need to use a small part of it.

You write code as though the entire tree exists, and `willow` will quitely add and cache nodes as you traverse the tree.

Willow clocks in at about 90 SLOC: pretty small indeed!

# Chess

Chess has an **extremely** large branching factor. Sometimes, it's useful to abstract away move generation and focus on how we traverse a position. This is where lazy trees come in.

This is also applicable to other games with large branching factors, such as Go.

===

```rust

impl Node for Board {
  fn children(&self) -> Vec<Self> {
    self.legal_moves()
  }

  fn leaf(&self) -> bool {
    self.is_over()
  }
}

```

===

# File systems

File systems are also a good example of a tree that could be very deep but onlt as small part of it is used. For example, if you're looking for a file in a directory, you don't need to traverse the entire directory tree.

===

```rust
impl Node for Dir {
  fn children(&self) -> Vec<Self> {
    self.subdirs()
  }

  fn leaf(&self) -> bool {
    self.files().is_empty()
  }
}
```

===

# Traversal

Let's define a function, `walk` which simply walks depth-first through a tree.

It's that simple! From a few rules, we can derive a lot of functionality.

===

```rust

fn walk(tree: &mut Tree<Node>, id: Id) {
  for child in &mut tree.children(id) {
    println!("{:?}", tree.get(*child).unwrap());
    walk(tree, *child);
  }
}

```

===

# Unrendered

Sometimes, we only want to iterate over parts of the tree which have already been rendered. This might be because creating new branches is expensive, or because we want to avoid traversing deeper than we have already.

Traversing rendered nodes is as simple as changing `children` to `rendered_children`.

===

```
tree.children(id)
```
â†“
```
tree.rendered_children(id)
```

# Transposition

In some trees there will be some nodes which naturally have multiple parents:

- Chess: the same position can be reached from different positions
- Symbolic links: a directory can be the target of a symlink from multiple places, and be the child of a parent directory simultaneously

We can solve this using a transposition table: define a hash function for each node, and use it to check if a node has already been added to the tree. If it has, we can redirect to the first instance of the node.

This, technically, is no longer a tree, but a directed acyclic graph. However, it's still useful to think of it as a tree.

## Performance

At first, it may seem like this could be extremely slow. Searching through a hash table for a node is `O(n)`, and we only have to do it when we add nodes.

In practice, this is not a problem. The performance impact of a hash table on small trees is negligible, and the performance impact of a hash table on large trees compensates for the cost of maintaining two identical sub-trees below nodes with the same hash.

===

```rust
// check if child is already in the tree
if let Some(c) = self.hash_table.get(&child) {
    // if so, append the existing node
    // instead of creating a new one
    id.append(*c, &mut self.arena);
    continue;
}

self.add_child(id, child);
```

Writing `willow` introduced me to making and publishing rust crates. It's unlikely to be useful to anyone else, but I'm glad I wrote it. It was a fun exercise.
