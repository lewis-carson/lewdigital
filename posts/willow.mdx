title: Building Lazy Trees
---

Today I wrote a small crate [willow](https://crates.io/crates/willowtree) that can be used to lazily traverse trees. It's a bit of a niche library, but I thought I'd share it anyway.

The idea is that you can build a tree of nodes, and then traverse it in a lazy fashion. This is useful if you have a tree that is very deep, but you only need to use a small part of it.

You write code as though the entire tree exists, and `willow` will quitely add and cache nodes as you traverse the tree.

Willow clocks in at about 60 SLOC: pretty small indeed!

# Chess

Chess has an **extremely** large branching factor. Sometimes, it's useful to abstract away move generation and focus on how we traverse a position. This is where lazy trees come in.

This is also applicable to other games with large branching factors, such as Go.

===

```rust

impl Node for Board {
  fn children(&self) -> Vec<Self> {
    self.legal_moves()
  }

  fn leaf(&self) -> bool {
    self.is_over()
  }
}

```

# File systems

File systems are also a good example of a tree that could be very deep but onlt as small part of it is used. For example, if you're looking for a file in a directory, you don't need to traverse the entire directory tree.

===

```rust
impl Node for Dir {
  fn children(&self) -> Vec<Self> {
    self.subdirs()
  }

  fn leaf(&self) -> bool {
    self.files().is_empty()
  }
}
```

Writing `willow` introduced me to making and publishing rust crates. It's unlikely to be useful to anyone else, but I'm glad I wrote it. It was a fun exercise.
